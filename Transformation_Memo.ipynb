                "# Transformation Memo: Board of Directors, Kaspi.kz\n",
                "\n",
                "**To:** Board of Directors, Kaspi.kz  \n",
                "**From:** Product Operating Model Consultant  \n",
                "**Date:** 2026-01-24  \n",
                "**Subject:** Urgent Pivot Required: Escaping the Feature Factory Trap\n",
                "\n",
                "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
                "Kaspi.kz is currently operating as a high-functioning **Feature Factory**, achieving scale through sheer execution force rather than sustainable product innovation. While financial results are strong, the organizational reliance on \"IT\" service delivery and business-appointed leadership creates a fragile structure of mercenaries that will fail to innovate as market complexity increases.\n",
                "\n",
                "## 2. Evidence of Feature Factory Behavior\n",
                "Despite external success, internal signals reveal an output-centric culture inconsistent with the Product Operating Model:\n",
                "\n",
                "*   **Engineering as a Service (IT Mindset):**\n",
                "    > \"One of our main recruitment priorities is entry level IT positions.\" (ESG Report, p.31)\n",
                "    *Signal:* Referring to engineers as \"IT\" frames them as back-office cost centers (Mercenaries) rather than the core business value creators. In a product company, technology *is* the business.\n",
                "\n",
                "*   **Stakeholder-Driven Roadmap (Lack of Empowerment):**\n",
                "    > \"Each team has a leader, or product head, who is usually appointed from within the business... This approach helps us make decisions quickly.\" (ESG Report, p.30)\n",
                "    *Signal:* Appointing leaders \"from the business\" typically delegates engineers to order-takers. True empowerment requires skilled Product Managers who discover *value*, not just Project Managers who deliver *requests*.\n",
                "\n",
                "*   **Output-Centric Competence:**\n",
                "    > \"Kaspi Lab... master applied skills in 7 areas... Oracle, MS SQL, Testing and accounting.\" (ESG Report, p.32)\n",
                "    *Signal:* Training focuses entirely on *delivery tools* (SQL, Oracle) and *compliance* (Accounting). There is zero mention of Product Discovery, User Research, or Prototyping—skills required to figure out *what* to build, not just *how* to build it.\n",
                "\n",
                "## 3. Strategic Disconnects\n",
                "*   **The \"Super App\" Trap:** The strategy relies on bundling services (\"synergetic with everything else\") rather than ensuring each product solves a distinct, viable customer problem on its own. This masks poor product performance with forced ecosystem integration.\n",
                "*   **Mercenary Culture disguised as Mission:** While the \"mission\" is stated, the structural reality (IT Dept + Business Owners) creates a culture where success is measured by \"shipping features\" (e.g., Digital Documents, Tax Reports) rather than solving hard problems.\n",
                "*   **GovTech as Vanity:** High usage of government services (\"11 million users\") is cited as success, but this is often a captive audience necessity, not a validation of product-market fit or user love.\n",
                "\n",
                "## 4. The Prescription\n",
                "To transition from a Feature Factory to an Empowered Product Organization, the Board must mandate:\n",
                "\n",
                "*   **Transform \"IT\" into Product Engineering:** Abolish the concept of \"IT\". Reorganize into durable, cross-functional Product Teams where engineers sit with designers and are measured by *business outcomes*, not \"projects delivered\".\n",
                "*   **Install Competent Product Management:** Stop appointing \"business heads\" as proxy product owners. Hire and train true **Product Managers** capable of running Product Discovery—assessing Value, Usability, Feasibility, and Viability *before* code is written.\n",
                "*   **Fund Outcomes, Not Projects:** Shift the budgeting model from funding specific deliverables (e.g., \"Build the Tax Report feature\") to funding business objectives (e.g., \"Reduce Small Business Tax Compliance Friction by 50%\"). Give teams the autonomy to find the best solution.\n"
