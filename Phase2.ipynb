    "### Role: Product Manager / JTBD Lead\n",
    "**Company: Kaspi.kz**\n",

    "**Domain: Procurement & Legal Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Purpose of Phase 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Phase 2 is to move beyond high-level organizational diagnosis and identify a specific, actionable internal problem that can be solved with an AI-enabled product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework, this phase simulates a real internal user and applies the 5 Whys technique to uncover the root cause behind surface-level inefficiencies.\n",
    "The goal is not to justify AI usage, but to determine whether AI meaningfully reduces risk, fear, or friction in a critical internal workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Identified Problem (Derived from Phase 1 Insights)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the Strategic Diagnosis (Phase 1), Kaspi.kz demonstrates high digital maturity at the product level.\n",
    "However, **internal control-heavy functions (Procurement / Legal)** remain constrained by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High audit pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strict compliance accountability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fear of personal responsibility for contractual errors\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests a gap between **organizational digital maturity** and **internal operational confidence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Simulated User Persona (AI Persona)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *AI Persona Profile*\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: Senior Procurement Officer  \n",
    "Company: Kaspi.kz  \n",
    "Experience: 8+ years in procurement and contract review  \n",
    "Context:\n",
    "- Works with supplier and service contracts daily\n",
    "- Operates under constant audit and compliance oversight\n",
    "- Final approval decisions carry personal accountability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Pain:**\n",
    "Fear of approving incorrect contract clauses that may trigger audits,\n",
    "penalties, or reputational damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "Avoid mistakes and personal liability, even at the cost of speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Behavior:**\n",
    "Prefers manual, repetitive review processes over automation due to\n",
    "lack of trust and decision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________\n",

    "### **2.4 JTBD Interview Log (5 Whys)**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Product Manager Question | AI Persona Response |\n",
    "|----|--------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 1 | Why does the procurement approval process take so long? | Because every contract must be manually reviewed in detail before approval. |\n",
    "| 2 | Why is manual review required for every contract? | Because even small mistakes can lead to audits, penalties, or internal investigations. |\n",
    "| 3 | Why is there no reliance on templates or partial automation? | Templates do not explain risks, and automation does not protect me from responsibility if something goes wrong. |\n",
    "| 4 | Why is personal responsibility such a strong blocker? | Accountability is individual. If an error is found, the approving officer is responsible, not the system. |\n",
    "| 5 | Why is fear stronger than efficiency in this process? | There is no safety net — no decision support that explains risks, flags issues clearly, or supports my judgment. |\n",

    "### **2.5 Key Insight (Root Cause)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The core problem is not speed or workload.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> It is fear of personal accountability caused by the absence of explainable decision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procurement officers do not resist automation because they are inefficient,\n",
    "but because **automation does not reduce personal risk.**\n",
    "This shifts the problem framing from operational efficiency to psychological\n",
    "and governance-driven risk avoidance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2.6 Job to Be Done (JTBD Statement)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When reviewing procurement and legal contracts,\n",
    "I want clear, explainable risk highlighting and policy references,\n",
    "so that I can approve decisions faster without fear of violating compliance\n",

    "   - Provide source-based explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explainability\n",

    "   - No black-box decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Read-Only Decision Support\n",
    "   - AI does not approve or reject contracts\n",

    "### **2.8 Phase 2 Output Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase demonstrates that the proposed AI Agent is not designed to replace human judgment, but to **reduce cognitive load** and **compliance anxiety** by providing transparent, explainable decision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of Phase 2 directly inform:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The **ROI calculation** in Phase 3 (time savings)\n",
