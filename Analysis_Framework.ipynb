                "## Executive Summary\n",
                "Kaspi.kz exhibits a high degree of Product Operating Model maturity. The organization is structured around empowered product teams (\"Missionaries\") with a clear focus on business and social outcomes rather than mere output. Technology is positioned as the core business enabler, not a support function, though some traditional nomenclature (\"IT\") persists in recruitment and events.\n",

                "**Assessment: Missionaries (High Maturity)**\n",
                "Kaspi.kz empowers teams with clear ownership and a strong mission connection.\n",
                "\n",
                "*   **Evidence:** \"Kaspi.kz’s mission is to improve people’s lives by developing innovative mobile products and services.\" (Page 3)\n",
                "*   **Evidence:** \"Each team has a leader, or product head, who is usually appointed from within the business and is responsible for a specific product. This approach helps us make decisions quickly... For employees the benefits are increased responsibility, clear expectations and accelerated career growth.\" (Page 30)\n",
                "    *   *Analysis:* This explicitly describes the \"Empowered Product Team\" model where a leader owns the product and decisions, fostering specific accountability (Missionaries) rather than taking orders (Mercenaries).\n",
                "*   **Evidence:** \"Direct responsibility is fundamental to the way we work... The concept of directly responsible individuals... refers to the person, with whom accountability for any given product sits.\" (Page 30)\n",

                "While the finance mechanics are not detailed, the strategy reflects continuous investment in value streams and \"capex lite\" scaling rather than discrete, heavy project budgeting.\n",

                "*   **Evidence:** \"We operate a unique, two-sided Super App model... best-in-class, highly relevant digital products and a capex lite approach.\" (Page 3)\n",
                "    *   *Analysis:* \"Capex lite\" implies avoiding the \"Project\" trap of heavy upfront capitalization, favoring continuous digital iteration (Opex/Product funding).\n",
                "*   **Evidence:** \"We immediately make our new GovTech products available via open platform... Although we do not generate revenue directly from GovTech services, they’re synergetic with everything else.\" (Page 18)\n",
                "    *   *Analysis:* Investing in non-revenue generating products for ecosystem synergy is a hallmark of strategic Product Funding, whereas Project Funding would likely kill such initiatives for lack of direct ROI.\n",
                "*   **Evidence:** \"We have once again allocated substantial funds for multiple charitable initiatives.\" (Page 19)\n",
                "    *   *Analysis:* Shows ability to allocate funds to strategic themes (Outcomes) rather than just revenue features.\n",

                "    *   *Analysis:* Uses \"IT\" as a functional discipline label for hiring, but placing them in product teams (see Section 1) negates the \"IT Dept\" service-bureau risk.\n",
                "*   **Evidence:** \"Our proprietary data... gives us unique and superior insights... continuously improve with each additional transaction... We can add a new data point within one second and fully update our models in less than one hour.\" (Page 21)\n",
